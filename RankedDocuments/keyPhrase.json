According to \nVECER, 1,036 respondents were classified by age and residence, but \nthe paper did not explain the methodology or give the margin of \nerror.  For the purpose of comparison, the paper cited the results \nof an unidentified poll made in May 1993. The approval/disapproval \nratings, in percent, for ten Macedonian politicians were: \n\n                                           November 1993    May 1993 \n\nKiro Gligorov, President of the Republic      76/15           78/13 \n\nVasil Tupurkovski, former Macedonian          50/36           43/37 \n   official in Federal Yugoslavia \n\nLjubomir Frckovski, Interior Minister         50/42           42/43 \n\nStojan Andov, Parliamentary Chairman          48/41           48/39 \n\nBranko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister            46/41           44/38 \n\nVlado Popovski, Defense Minister              41/41           36/37 \n\nStevo Crvenkovski, Foreign Minister           40/43   No Data Given \n\nPetar Gosev, Democratic Party leader          34/53           40/42 \n\nTodor Petrov, Independent parliamentarian     32/53   No Data Given \n\nNikola Popovski, Social Democratic            29/46           32/42 \n   Party parliamentarian \n\n   VECER noted that President Gligorov's very high approval rating \nof 90 percent among those over age 65 fell off to a still high 70 \npercent among respondents between 18 and 24.  Residents of Skopje \nranked the politicians in a slightly different order from the \nranking given by the whole sample: Gligorov, Tupurkovski, Frckovski, \nAndov, Gosev, Branko Crvenkovski, Vlado Popovski, Petrov, Nikola \nPopovski, and Stevo Crvenkovski. \n\n   The results of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Agency \nfor Public Opinion Research and published \"exclusively\" by the \nSkopje weekly PULS newspaper, confirmed Gligorov's substantial lead \nin popularity among political figures.  According to the 31 December \n1993 issue of PULS (pages 16-18), the agency gathered the data by \nmeans of telephone interviews with 300 residents in the Republic of \nMacedonia during 20-24 December. PULS also provided data from \nsurveys made in March, June, and September for comparison.  Some of \nthe following percentages are approximate values that were derived \nfrom the graph published by the paper: \n\n                         March       June      September    December \n\nKiro Gligorov             87          82.33      89.33           89 \nStevo Crvenkovski         54          65         49              63 \nStojan Andov              61          62         60              61 \nBranko Crvenkovski        56          60         54 \n53.5 \nLjubomir Frckovski        35          45         48              50 \nPetar Gosev               50          31         52 \n49.53 \nJovan Andonov, \n Deputy Prime Minister    39          39         50              37 \nVlado Popovski            18          25         36              35 \nKiro Popovski, Deputy \n Chairman, Parliament     26          27         33              32 \nAnte Popovski, leader of \n MAAK (Movement for All- \n Macedonian Action)       29          32         32 \nindistinct \nJane Miljovski, Minister \n without Portfolio        --          23         31              24 \nVladimir Golubovski \n VMRO-DP (Internal \n Macedonian Revolutionary \n Organization-Democratic \n Party) leader            --          30         25              23 \nNevzat Halili \n Party for Democratic \n Prosperity official      38.33       38         18              18 \n\nLj upco Georgievski \nVMRO-DPMNE (Internal \nMacedonian Revolutionary \nOrganization-Democratic \nParty for Macedonian \nNational Unity) \nofficial                  18          10         16              17 \nDosta Dimovska \nVMRO-DPMNE \nofficial                  --          11         17              16 \n\n   On pages 6 and 7 of its 15-16 January issue, VECER also published \nthe results of a November 1993 survey on party preferences. \n\"BriMa,\" working with the Gallup organization, interviewed 1,036 \npeople. \n\n   Question: \"If elections were held today, for which party would \nyou vote?\" (all numbers are percentages) \n\nSDSM (Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia)  22.8 \nVMRO-DPMNE                                      11.2 \nDemocratic Party (DP, led by Petar Gosev)        6.3 \nSocialist Party                                  3.3 \nLiberal Party (LP)                               3.2 \nWorkers Party                                    2.9 \nPCERM (Party for the Full Emancipation of \n    Romanies in Macedonia)                       1.8 \nDemocratic Party of Turks in Macedonia           0.8 \nMAAK                                             0.3 \nAnother party                                    4.0 \nUndecided                                       18.6 \nWould not vote                                   6.6 \n\n   VECER noted that some parties fared better in certain cities than \ntheir overall scores indicate.  For example, the DP was about twice \nas popular in Skopje as elsewhere, getting 12.1 percent in the \ncapital; the VMRO-DPMNE was more popular in Bitola, getting 15.7 \npercent, than in the remainder of the country; and the LP in the \nBregalnica area got the support of 10.6 percent, substantially \nhigher than the 3.2 percent support it received overall. \n\n   Question: \"Do you have confidence in the following parties?\" (all \nnumbers are percentages) \n\n              Yes           No       Do Not Know \n\nSDSM           28           51          21 \nVMRO-DPMNE     15           72          14 \nLP             19           59          22 \nPDP-NDP*       20           73           7 \n\n*Party for Democratic Prosperity-People's Democratic Party \n\n   The poll clearly indicated that Macedonians have little \nconfidence in any of the parties currently active in the country. \nRespondents were also asked whether it would be good for the country \nto have elections sooner than scheduled; 62 percent agreed, 20 \npercent disagreed, and 18 percent did not know. These findings were \ncorrelated with party preferences, producing the following results: \nOf those who would vote for the SDSM, 54 percent wanted elections \nsoon, while 34 percent were against early elections. However, 80 \npercent of VMRO-DPMNE supporters favored elections soon, as did 79 \npercent of LP supporters and 71 percent of DP supporters. While 80 \npercent of those surveyed thought that a person should vote (14 \npercent did not agree), only 40 percent thought that it was very \nimportant which party won the elections and 27 percent thought it \nwas somewhat significant. \n\n   (AUTHOR:  GALYEAN.

It provides key information about the media \nof Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia, Slovenia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n(incorporating Serbia and Montenegro).  Wherever possible, an \nat tempt has been made to identify affiliations or reliably \nreported connections between media sources and governmental or \ncommunal leadership groups. \n\n   All media identified in this guide are monitored by FBIS, but \nin some cases, due to wartime conditions, receipts have been \nirregular and the information provided in the guide may be \nincomplete.  Characterizations, where provided, are based on FBIS \nanalysis of editorial content.  Entries are grouped by region, \nand, within regions, by category: publications, radio, \ntelevision, and news agencies.  The \"sourcelines\" cited at the \nbeginning of each entry are the descriptors used by FBIS to \nidentify media sources of FBIS translations.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                                 Pyongyang's response to the latest South Korean proposal for \nresumption of inter-Korean talks seems to reflect an effort by \nthe North Korean regime to score polemical points against the \nSouth and its ongoing preference for negotiating with Washington \nover Seoul on the nuclear issue. \n\n                            END SUMMARY \n\n   Apparently violating a recent DPRK-U.S. agreement, Pyongyang \ncountered Seoul's proposal for a 1 March working-level contact \nwith a later date, a counterproposal that seemed aimed mainly at \ngaining some perceived polemical advantage over Seoul.  According \nto Pyongyang radio on 1 March, Pak Yong-su, North Korean chief \ndelegate to the proposed working-level talks, sent a telephone \nmessage to his Southern counterpart proposing a meeting on 3 \nMarch.  Pyongyang's attempt to delay the North-South meeting for \ntwo days seemed to violate an agreement it had reportedly reached \nwith Washington for resumption of high-level DPRK-U.S talks.  The \n25 February agreement, announced by Pyongyang radio on 28 \nFebruary, specified 1 March as the date the following will take \nplace \"simultaneously\": \n\n   + Seoul will announce its decision to discontinue this year's \nrunning of Team Spirit and Washington will announce its consent \nto Seoul's decision. \n\n   + The International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear \ninspections in the North to ensure continuity of safeguards. \n\n   + Inter-Korean contacts will start at Panmunjom to discuss \nexchanging of special presidential envoys. \n\n   + Pyongyang and Washington will announce resumption of high-level \nbilateral talks to take place on 21 March in Geneva. \n\n   Pyongyang's Motives In proposing a later date for North-South \ncontacts, Pyongyang may have been showing its concern about \nappearing to cave in to pressure on the issue of nuclear \ninspections and its continued reluctance to deal with anyone but \nWashington on the nuclear issue.  In the latest attempt to \nportray Seoul as irrelevant on the nuclear issue, the party paper \nNodong Sinmun in a 28 February commentary ridiculed ROK President \nKim Yong-sam for allegedly acting \"as if he receives U.S. reports \non DPRK-U.S. talks\" and \"as if he controls the talks\" (Pyongyang \nradio, 28 February).  Kim creates this impression, the commentary \nadded, even though \"he is not even qualified to join the talks.\" \n\n   Pyongyang's reluctance to engage Seoul in anything of substance \nwas also evident in the sheer contempt for President Kim North \nKorea expressed in commenting on Kim's 25 February press \nconference commemorating the first year of his presidency. \nDeparting from its past practice of avoiding extreme personal \nattacks on South Korean leaders during periods of inter-Korean \ndialogue, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 27 February heaped \nabuse on President Kim, calling him, inter alia, a \"traitor,\" a \n\"puppet,\" and a \"political mountebank,\" accusing him of \"arch \ncrimes of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, repression,\" and \npromoting national \"division and confrontation,\" and  of plain \n\"stupidity.\"  KCNA went on to claim that Kim's remarks about the \nprobable absence of nuclear arms in the North and his proposal \nfor an inter-Korean summit constituted a de facto admission that \nhis \"criminal\" policy \"against the North\" had been wrong.  The \nparty paper Nodong Sinmun on 28 February similarly ridiculed \nKim's \"preposterously absurd remarks\" (Pyongyang radio). \n\n   DPRK-U.S. Talks In sharp contrast to its reluctance to meet \nwith Seoul, Pyongyang was upbeat about the prospect of upcoming \ntalks with Washington.  Although monitored Pyongyang media have \nnot commented on the news of the upcoming high-level bilateral \ntalks, Ambassador Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korea's mission \nto the United Nations, was depicted in South Korean media as \nbeing optimistic about the eventual outcome of the negotiations. \nIn an interview with the Seoul daily Hangyore Sinmun (28 \nFebruary), Ho termed it \"fortunate\" that Washington, \"although \nbelatedly,\" withdrew \"unjustified preconditions\" to resumption of \nthe high-level talks, thus paving way for \"a package solution\" of \n\"not only the nuclear issue, but also other issues now standing \nin the way of diplomatic normalization. \n\n   Implications Pyongyang's contrasting media treatment of \nWashington and Seoul indicates that the North Korean leadership \ncontinues to prefer the United States as partner for nuclear \nnegotiations and is inclined to limit talks with the South to the \nminimum required to fulfill preconditions to resumption of high- \nlevel talks with Washington. \n\n(AUTHOR:  YIM.

        "text": "\n\nThe     following summaries highlight information from articles that \nappeared in the Algiers French- and regional Arabic-language press \nin January and February. \n\n   Liamine Zeroual's Image Favorable \n\n   A report in the Arabic-language Doha (Qatar) daily AL-SHARQ of 3 \nFebruary states that the public views newly elected President \nLiamine Zeroual as a very shrewd and experienced military man who \ncan return Algeria \"to the days of Boumedienne.\"  According to the \nreport,  Zeroual is seen as the man who can end the confrontation \nbetween the Islamists and the nationalists since he effectively \npushed for dialogue and reconciliation when he was defense minister. \nZeroual reportedly considers nationalism inseparable from Islam as \npart of his new national order:  \"Zeroual goes back to the origins \nof the Algerian revolution when nationalism embraced Islam during \nthe battle for independence.  In the sixties the two diverged. \nNationalism embraced socialism and Islam was marginalized.  When \nsocialism failed, Islam came back forcefully.\"  Zeroual has \nreportedly created a positive image through his efforts as defense \nminister to deal in a positive manner with both the (Islamic \nSalvation Front) FIS and the regime.  As a result, FIS leader Rabah \nKebir says his party anticipates that Zeroual will change policy, \nbut not necessarily replace government officials.  According to the \nreport, Kebir's statement indicates that the FIS is becoming more \nflexible and wants to undertake serious dialogue with authorities, \nparticularly in light of the communications that took place before \nand after the National Dialogue in January. \n\n   Influx of Refugees in the South Provokes Concern \n\n   French-language Algiers daily EL WATAN of 10 and 23 January has \nreported that Algerian Tuareg frustration and anger is growing in \nTamanrasset because of the high number of illegal foreigners (mainly \nfrom Niger, Mali, and Ghana) who reportedly outnumber Algerians in \nthe region.  The Tuaregs hold these foreigners responsible for \nincreasing crime rates, attacks against tourists, and drug \ntrafficking which weakens the economy and creates a security problem \nin the region.  Hadj Moussa Akhmokh, a prominent Tuareg authority, \nsays a 1992 plan to improve regional security was unsuccessful and \nthat \"the situation has become worse.\"  In December, for example, \nthe two national firms National Company for Mining Research \n(SONAREM) and Center for Energy Research (CREM) were looted and \nseveral vehicles were stolen. In addition, customs officials from \nTamanrasset were kidnapped by a group of individuals armed with \nKalashnikovs, robbed, and taken to Niger where they were manhandled \nbefore being released. According to Hadj Akhamokh, the more recent \nkidnapping of 18 Tuaregs (10 Algerians and eight Malians) set a \n\"serious\" precedent and was the \n\"last straw.\" Citizens planned a peaceful march to demonstrate their \nanger and to attract the attention of authorities until Hadj \nAkhamokh convinced them to postpone the march.  Hadj Akhmokh stated \nthe Tuaregs have responded to his appeal, but that they are \n\"impatient,\" and are waiting for the government to take control of \nthe situation. \n\n   According to Hadj Akhamokh, smuggling is also a serious problem. \nHe faults local police for participating in the corruption and \nallowing it to continue.  Food shipments intended for the local \npopulation are being purchased and resold for twice the price across \nthe border, including milk which has been unavailable in the markets \nfor \"months.\"  According to Hadj Akhmokh, \"smuggling has grown to \nproportions that the Tuaregs can no longer tolerate. To starve the \npeople is to push us to revolt.\" (See FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE FB PN \n93-151 \"Regional Census Prompted by Security, Economic Concerns,\" 8 \nApril 1993, and NEAR EAST SOUTH ASIA REPORT 93AFO622B \"Illegal \nImmigrants in South; Census Unreported,\" 12 May 1993 p 11 for \nadditional reporting on this subject.) \n\n   'Terrorists' Exert Pressure; Press, Lifestyle Threatened \n\n   EL WATAN of 16 January reported that \"terrorist threats\" have \npromoted a climate of fear in the town of Meftah, \"imposing a life \nstyle that has nothing to do with Algerian society.\"  According to \nthe report, Meftah and Medea have become towns which immerse \nthemselves more and more in Islamic, even \"fundamentalist,\" \ntendencies.  For example, the article stated that tracts posted \nthroughout Meftah threaten that women who do not wear the hijab and \nwho wear Western style clothes will \"have to deal with us.\"  In \naddition threats have been made against beauty salons, Moorish \nbaths, and cassette vendors.  \"Fundamentalists\" have also attacked \nthe press, declaring it \"unsuitable reading.\"  EL WATAN reported in \nthree articles from 16 to 18 January that newspaper vendors and \nbookstores in Blida, Medea, ChIef, and El Khemis were no longer \nselling newspapers.  According to EL WATAN of 16 January, national \npublications, particularly those of the independent press, have \nsuddenly disappeared from the shelves due to \"terrorist threats.\" \nOne citizen reported, \"Don't use my name, but I am afraid to tell \nyou that tobacco shops and bookstores are scared to death. They are \nconvinced that if they continue to sell newspapers there could be \nserious reprisals.\"  EL WATAN of 17 and 18 January reported that \nvendors have denied the threats, blaming distributors for failing to \ndeliver the newspapers.  Nonetheless, security services have ordered \nmerchants to sell newspapers or be shut down. \n\n   Citizens Reportedly Buying Visas \n\n   An article in the French-language daily ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 19 \nJanuary recounted the frustrations of dozens of Algerians trying to \nobtain French visas.  Given the evening curfew, many spend the night \nin nearby hotels or in the elevators or hallways of neighboring \nbuildings.  According to the report, lines can begin as early as 4 \na.m., causing citizens to resort to purchasing a place in line for \n500-1000 dirhams, depending on the position in line and the time it \nis purchased.  In the words of one citizen, \"It is a real stock \nexchange.\"  The French consulate reportedly closed for two days and \nsuspended issuing visas in an effort to set up a new system whereby \nvisa requests would be handled through the mail. \n\n   (QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, AFRICA/LEVANT \nBRANCH AT (703)  733-6408) \nENEAG/01 Mar/POLCHF/ECONF/TOTF/NEASA Division/jf 1/2129Z MAR \n\n\n",
