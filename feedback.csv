myfw58yo,Reentry to Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery During the COVID19 Pandemic.,"Patients with obesity and diabetes have higher risk for severe complications and mortality from COVID19 infection. In addition, unexpected mortalities were reported in a small series of asymptomatic COVID19-positive patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Several organization including IFSO and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) endorsed recommendations to suspend elective nonessential surgery including MBS during the peak period of COVID19. However, both recommendations have no clear guidelines on how to prioritize MBS patients after the peak of COVID19 cases has passed, but there remain patients with asymptomatic COVID19 in the community. We present a tiered approach to restart MBS during the COVID19 pandemic once the peak of new cases has passed or the curve of new COVID19 cases has flattened.","Several organization including IFSO and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) endorsed recommendations to suspend elective nonessential surgery including MBS during the peak period of COVID19.

itbhorxo,Association of Poor Housing Conditions with COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality Across US Counties,"Objective: Poor housing conditions have been linked with worse health outcomes and infectious spread in communities but its relationship with incidence and mortality of COVID19 is unknown. Therefore, we undertook this study to determine the association between poor housing condition and COVID19 incidence and mortality in US counties. Methods: We conducted cross sectional analysis of county level data from the US Centers for Disease Control, US Census Bureau and John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center for 3141 US counties. The exposure of interest was percentage of households with poor housing conditions (one or more of: overcrowding, high housing cost, incomplete kitchen facilities, or incomplete plumbing facilities). Outcomes were incidence rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR) of COVID19 across US counties through 4/21/2020. Multilevel generalized linear modeling was utilized with adjustment for population density and county characteristics including demographics, income, education, prevalence of medical comorbidities, access to healthcare insurance and emergency rooms, and state level COVID19 test density. Results: Across 3135 US counties, the mean percentage of households with poor housing conditions was 14.2% (range 2.7%, 60.2%). The mean (SD) incidence and mortality of COVID19 were 255.68 (2877.03) cases and 13.90 (272.22) deaths per county, respectively. In the fully adjusted models, with each 5% increase in percent households with poor housing conditions, there was a 50% higher risk of COVID19 incidence (IRR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.38,1.62) and a 42% higher risk of COVID19 mortality (MRR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.25,1.61). Results remained similar using earlier timepoints (3/31/2020 and 4/10/2020). Conclusions and Relevance: Counties with a higher percentage of households with poor housing had higher incidence of, and mortality associated with, COVID19. These findings suggest targeted health policies to support individuals living in poor housing conditions should be considered in further efforts to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with COVID19.","Results: Across 3135 US counties, the mean percentage of households with poor housing conditions was 14.2% (range 2.7%, 60.2%).

mrsjhjh4,Estimating Preventable COVID19 Infections Related to Elective Outpatient Surgery in Washington State: A Quantitative Model,"Background: As the number of suspected and confirmed COVID19 cases in the US continues to rise, the US surgeon general, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and several specialty societies have issued recommendations to consider canceling elective surgeries. However, these recommendations have also faced controversy and opposition. Objective: The goal of this study is to provide a quantitative analysis and model for preventable COVID19 infections from elective outpatient or ambulatory surgery cases, which can also be adapted to analyze COVID19 transmission in other healthcare settings. Furthermore, given the controversy over the appropriate handling of elective surgical cases during this pandemic, we hope that our results may have a positive impact on health policy and public health. Methods: Using previously published information on elective ambulatory or outpatient surgical procedures and publicly available data on COVID19 infections in the US and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we calculated a transmission rate and generated a mathematical model to predict a lower bound for the number of healthcare-acquired COVID19 infections that could be prevented by canceling or postponing elective outpatient surgeries in Washington state. Results: Our model predicts that over the course of 30 days, at least 2445 preventable patient infections and at least 1557 preventable healthcare worker (HCW) infections would occur in WA state alone if elective outpatient procedures were to continue as usual. The majority of these infections are caused by transmission from HCW who became infected at work. Conclusion: Given the large numbers of COVID19 infections that could be prevented by canceling elective outpatient surgeries, our findings support the recommendations of the US Surgeon General, CDC, American College of Surgeons (ACS), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), and Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) to consider rescheduling or postponing elective surgeries until the COVID19 pandemic is under better control in the US.","Methods: Using previously published information on elective ambulatory or outpatient surgical procedures and publicly available data on COVID19 infections in the US and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we calculated a transmission rate and generated a mathematical model to predict a lower bound for the number of healthcare-acquired COVID19 infections that could be prevented by canceling or postponing elective outpatient surgeries in Washington state.

xp2dlrry,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE1, ACE2) gene variants are associated with COVID19 severity depending on the hypertension status.","Background: The Angiotensin system is implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID19. First, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARS-COv-2, and expression of the ACE2 gene could regulate the individuals susceptibility to infection. In addition, the balance between ACE1 and ACE activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases and could play a role in the severity of COVID19. Functional ACE1 and ACE2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and could thus also contribute to the outcome of COVID19. Methods: We studied 204 COVID19 patients (137 non-severe and 67 severe-ICU cases) and 536 age-matched controls. The ACE1 indel and ACE2 rs2285666 polymorphism were determined. Variables frequencies were compared between the groups by logistic regression. We also sequenced the ACE2 coding nucleotides in a group of patients. Results: Severe COVID19 was associated with hypertension male gender (p<0.001), hypertension (p=0.006), hypercholesterolaemia (p=0.046), and the ACE1-DD genotype (p=0.049). In the multiple logistic regression hypertension (p=0.02, OR=2.26, 95CI=1.12-4.63) and male gender (p=0.002; OR=3.15, 95CI=1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of severity. The ACE2 polymorphism was not associated with the disease outcome. The ACE2 sequencing showed no coding sequence variants that could explain an increased risk of developing COVID19. Conclusions: Adverse outcome of COVID19 was associated with male gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and the ACE1 genotype. The ACE1-indel was a significant risk factor for severe COVID19, but the effect was dependent on the hypertensive status.","In the multiple logistic regression hypertension (p=0.02, OR=2.26, 95CI=1.12-4.63) and male gender (p=0.002; OR=3.15, 95CI=1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of severity.

uuzgbs2m,"Trends of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide: Role of population density, age structure, and climate on transmission and case fatality","Introduction The disease transmission pattern of COVID19 is highly heterogeneous, which suggests that the pandemic maybe driven by complex factors, which may include habitat suitability, region specific human mobility, and transmission related to susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different spatial and demographic factors on COVID19 transmission and case fatality worldwide. Methods We assessed SARS CoV2 virus transmission and COVID19 related fatalities in 50 countries in all continents of the globe. Data from the COVID19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the European center for disease control and prevention, and the World Health Organization were used to obtain the daily number of cases and organize the incidence data. Disease spread, was assessed using the reproduction number of the disease across the sampled countries. R0 package of R statistical software was used to estimate the reproduction number of the COVID19 using the exponential growth method. After computing the reproductive number of each country in the study, a multiple linear regression model was fitted by taking the R0 value as dependent variable, and latitude and population density as an independent variable. Disease severity was analyzed using the case fatality ratio of COVID19. The proportion of deaths to the total numbers of cases was meta analyzed using metaphor package of R statistical software using random effect inverse variance weighting to come up with the case fatality ratio. Results We found no statistically significant association between disease spread and latitude or population density. The regression model analysis that accounted for age, population density and latitude showed that age distribution remains an important driver shaping the current distribution of COVID19 cases. The relative frequency of people above 65 years old was positively correlated with the cumulative numbers of COVID19 cases as well as case fatality ratio in each country. The multiple linear regression model fitted between CFR and the three major covariates showed that, the demographic distribution of the sampled countries is strongly associated with the case fatality ratio. An increase in the elderly population proportion by 1 percent was associated with an increase in CFR by 0.32. Correlation with proportion of populations over 65 years old is concordant with the previous findings relationship between case fatality ratio and patient age. Conclusion This analysis provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health authorities. Particularly, as our study confirms that death and severity of COVID19 are associated with age, in countries with the biggest outbreaks, strategies must be employed to ensure that high risk groups, such as old people received adequate protection from COVID19.","Conclusion This analysis provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health authorities.

w4qb7207,COVID19 coagulopathy in Caucasian patients,"Although the pathophysiology underlying severe COVID19 remains poorly understood, accumulating data suggest that a lung-centric coagulopathy may play an important role. Elevated D-dimer levels which correlated inversely with overall survival were recently reported in Chinese cohort studies. Critically however, ethnicity has major effects on thrombotic risk, with a 3-4-fold lower risk in Chinese compared to Caucasians and a significantly higher risk in African-Americans. In this study, we investigated COVID19 coagulopathy in Caucasian patients. Our findings confirm that severe COVID19 infection is associated with a significant coagulopathy that correlates with disease severity. Importantly however, Caucasian COVID19 patients on low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylaxis rarely develop overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In rare COVID19 cases where DIC does develop, it tends to be restricted to late-stage disease. Collectively, these data suggest that the diffuse bilateral pulmonary inflammation observed in COVID19 is associated with a novel pulmonary-specific vasculopathy termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy (PIC) as distinct to DIC. Given that thrombotic risk is significantly impacted by race, coupled with the accumulating evidence that coagulopathy is important in COVID19 pathogenesis, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that pulmonary vasculopathy may contribute to the unexplained differences that are beginning to emerge highlighting racial susceptibility to COVID19 mortality.","Elevated D-dimer levels which correlated inversely with overall survival were recently reported in Chinese cohort studies.

urapl8c6,A note on 'Collider bias undermines our understanding of COVID-19 disease risk and severity' and how causal Bayesian networks both expose and resolve the problem,"An important recent preprint by Griffith et al highlights how 'collider bias' in studies of COVID19 undermines our understanding of the disease risk and severity. This is typically caused by the data being restricted to people who have undergone COVID19 testing, among whom healthcare workers are overrepresented. For example, collider bias caused by smokers being underrepresented in the dataset may (at least partly) explain empirical results that suggest smoking reduces the risk of COVID19. We extend the work of Griffith et al making more explicit use of graphical causal models to interpret observed data. We show that their smoking example can be clarified and improved using Bayesian network models with realistic data and assumptions. We show that there is an even more fundamental problem for risk factors like 'stress' which, unlike smoking, is more rather than less prevalent among healthcare workers; in this case, because of a combination of collider bias from the biased dataset and the fact that 'healthcare worker' is a confounding variable, it is likely that studies will wrongly conclude that stress reduces rather than increases the risk of COVID19. Indeed,""being in close contact with COVID19 people""reduces the risk of COVID19. To avoid such potentially erroneous conclusions, any analysis of observational data must take account of the underlying causal structure including colliders and confounders. If analysts fail to do this explicitly then any conclusions they make about the effect of specific risk factors on COVID19 are likely to be flawed.","This is typically caused by the data being restricted to people who have undergone COVID19 testing, among whom healthcare workers are overrepresented.
